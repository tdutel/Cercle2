## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Cercle2 contain 3 projects : Push_swap, so_long and Pipex. All these projects are individual.

## Push_swap <a name="pushswap"></a>

This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, we have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

## So_long <a name="solong"></a>

May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, we will always need a way to read content line by line. It's time to start working on this function, which will be essential for our future projects. View [So_long subject](https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle2/blob/main/so_long/en.subject.pdf)

## Pipex <a name="pipex"></a>

This project aims to deepen our understanding of the two concepts: Redirections and Pipes. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus. View [Pipex subject](https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle2/blob/main/pipex/en.subject.pdf)

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Copy link : https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle1.git
2. tap in terminal :
```
git clone https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle1.git
```
Theses functions will be added into libft.a from [Libft project](https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle0). There's really no point in copying this repo. It's more about showing how it works than using it directly.
